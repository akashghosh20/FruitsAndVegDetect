üçéüçâ Fruit and Vegetable Classifier üçáü•ï
Version: 1.0.0

Overview
The Fruit and Vegetable Classifier is a deep learning-based web application that allows users to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The app is powered by a TensorFlow Lite model and provides an intuitive, visually appealing UI using Streamlit.

Users can upload images of fruits or vegetables, and the model predicts the correct class from a wide variety of categories. This project is a practical demonstration of image classification in action, making it easy to explore how machine learning models can classify images of everyday objects.

Features
Upload & Classify: Users can upload an image (JPEG, PNG) of fruits or vegetables, and the AI will classify it.
TensorFlow Lite: Uses a TensorFlow Lite model for fast, efficient image inference.
Progress Indicator: A spinner shows progress while the model processes the image.
Prediction Visuals: Bar chart visualization of the model's prediction probabilities.
Modern UI: A clean, beautiful interface with custom styling using HTML and CSS inside Streamlit.
Demo
You can test this app by uploading an image of a fruit or vegetable, and it will provide a prediction. The UI includes a display of the uploaded image, a prediction result, and a chart visualizing the prediction's probability scores.

Dataset
The model was trained on a version of the Fruits-360 dataset. This dataset includes images of different types of fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and was curated to provide a variety of real-world examples for classification. Some of the categories include:

Apples (Golden, Red, Granny Smith, etc.)
Bananas (Yellow, Red)
Blueberries, Cherries, Grapes, Mangoes
Carrots, Cauliflower, Eggplant, Ginger
Peppers (Red, Green, Yellow)
And many more...
Installation
To set up and run the app locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
Streamlit
TensorFlow
Pillow (PIL)
Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fruit-veg-classifier.git
cd fruit-veg-classifier
Install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Upload an Image: Once the app is running, you can open the Streamlit web app in your browser. Upload an image, and the app will classify the image for you.

File Structure
bash
Copy code

How It Works
Upload: The user uploads an image through the interface.
Preprocessing: The image is resized and normalized to fit the TensorFlow Lite model's expected input.
Inference: The app runs the image through the TensorFlow Lite model, and the model returns the predicted class.
Output: The app displays the predicted label and visualizes the probability distribution of all classes using a bar chart.
Usage Example
Upload and Classify:
Go to the app interface.
Upload an image (JPEG/PNG) of a fruit or vegetable.
Wait for the prediction to complete. The app will display:
The uploaded image.
The predicted class.
A probability chart of the prediction scores.
UI Preview:
Here‚Äôs a glimpse of the UI with a clean, modern design, using custom CSS for enhancing the layout and visual appeal.
