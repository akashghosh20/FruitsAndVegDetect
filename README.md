üçéüçâ Fruit and Vegetable Classifier üçáü•ï
Version: 1.0.0

Overview
The Fruit and Vegetable Classifier is a deep learning-based web application that allows users to classify images of fruits and vegetables. The app is powered by a TensorFlow Lite model and provides an intuitive, visually appealing UI using Streamlit.

Users can upload images of fruits or vegetables, and the model predicts the correct class from a wide variety of categories. This project is a practical demonstration of image classification in action, making it easy to explore how machine learning models can classify images of everyday objects.

Features
Upload & Classify: Users can upload an image (JPEG, PNG) of fruits or vegetables, and the AI will classify it.
TensorFlow Lite: Uses a TensorFlow Lite model for fast, efficient image inference.
Progress Indicator: A spinner shows progress while the model processes the image.
Prediction Visuals: Bar chart visualization of the model's prediction probabilities.
Modern UI: A clean, beautiful interface with custom styling using HTML and CSS inside Streamlit.
Demo
You can test this app by uploading an image of a fruit or vegetable, and it will provide a prediction. The UI includes a display of the uploaded image, a prediction result, and a chart visualizing the prediction's probability scores.

Dataset
The model was trained on a version of the Fruits-360 dataset. This dataset includes images of different types of fruits, vegetables, and nuts, and was curated to provide a variety of real-world examples for classification. Some of the categories include:

Apples (Golden, Red, Granny Smith, etc.)
Bananas (Yellow, Red)
Blueberries, Cherries, Grapes, Mangoes
Carrots, Cauliflower, Eggplant, Ginger
Peppers (Red, Green, Yellow)
And many more...
